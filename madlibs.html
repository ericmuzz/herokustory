        Roger felt {{ context.adj1 }}. He decided to walk to the {{ context.noun1 }} for some {{ context.noun2 }}.
        On his way there, a {{ context.adj2 }} {{ context.noun3 }}, crawled out from the under the
        {{ context.noun4 }} and said “I have the key to your happiness, but you must pay the price.” Roger replied,
        “I’d really rather not talk about this right now, I’ve had a long day, really.” Roger {{ context.verb1 }} away
        and decided to {{ context.verb2 }} a new {{ context.noun5 }}. Finally, he came to a {{ context.adj3 }} {{ context.noun6 }},
        that turned to him and said, “ I have a lot of {{ context.noun7 }}, but what I’m really looking for is the key to
        human happiness.” Roger {{ context.verb3 }}. “That’s crazy, I just ran into a {{ context.adj2 }} {{ context.noun3 }} that
        totally has the key to your happiness, my {{ context.noun8 }},” Roger said. He {{ context.verb4 }} the {{ context.noun7 }} where
        to {{ context.verb5 }}. He felt good about himself momentarily, but then remembered that his {{ context.noun9 }}
        had {{ context.verb6 }} in a {{ context.adj4 }} {{ context.noun10 }}.
